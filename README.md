For the last working "stancecoke" version, switch to the v0.5 branch!  
https://github.com/Koxx3/SmartESC_STM32_v3/tree/v0.5

Attention: new logic to activate the autodetect procedure:. 
Pull the brake lever and press the dashboard button for 5 seconds!


Fork of EBiCS firmware for Lishui devices. Ported to Xaiomi M365 controller. 
Use JST PA series 2mm pitch for the connectors. (need to be confirmed) 

This branch works with the original M365 dashboard  

How to use:  
Method 1 (github account needed):  
Fork the project repository to your github account by clicking the "Fork" icon.  
Edit the config.h in your repository online and commit the changes.  
Click on the "Actions" button in the menu bar of the github page. There you can see the "workflows".  
Wait until the running workflow is finished, then click on the workflow headline.
Download the zipfile with the generated zipfile by clicking on the cube icon at the bottom of the page.  
You can find a tutorial at [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Pe2UTPPxX7U)  

Method 2 (lokal installation):  
Install the [STM Cube IDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html#overview&secondary=st-get-software)  
Start the IDE and install egit from the eclipse marketplace (Help --> Eclipse Marketplace...)  
Import this repo from github (File --> Import --> git --> Projects from git)  

Edit the file config.h (in the folder Core/Inc) according to your wishes. Working settings for the original M365 are in the comments, so use them to have a proven start setting.  

Click on "Build" (The icon with the hammer)  

in the folder /tools/zip-output the zip-file ready for use with your scooter is generated.
Copy it to your mobile phone and flash it to the scooter by the app downG.

After flashing, lift the motor, so it can spin in the air without load. Press the dashboard button for 5s, the autodetect routine starts. The motor turns slowly. After stopping, the scooter is ready to run.  

Dashboard button use:
